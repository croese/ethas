# Voting Theory Notes

### Desirable properties for a voting system
- **Anonymous**: No voter is preferred over any other. If you swap any two voters' ballots, the outcome won't change.
- **Neutral**: No candidate is preferred over any other. (Two-candidate scenario) If you switch all of the voters' ballot choices to the other candidate, the election results would also switch.
- **Monotonic**: Gaining votes should not turn a winning candidate into a losing one nor should losing votes turn a losing candidate into a winning candidate.

|               | Anonymous? | Neutral? | Monotone? |
|:---           | :---:      | :---:    | :---:     |
| Dictatorship  | No         | Yes      | Yes       |
| Imposed Rule  | Yes        | No       | Yes       |
| Minority Rule | Yes        | Yes      | No        |
| Majority Rule |   Yes      | Yes      | Yes       |

**Quota System**: A voting system with a number *q*, called the *quota*, such that a candidate wins if and only if they receive *q* votes.
